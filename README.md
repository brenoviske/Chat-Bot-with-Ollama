# Chat-Bot-with-Ollama
Hello Everyone!

Today I would like to present to all of you my latest project:
A chat bot programmed in Python with Ollama! ðŸ¦„ 

As I have mentioned before, Python is by far my favorite language when it comes to software development, due to its versatility and high range of libraries that can always enhance my coding skills, from Data Science to Machine Learning, both extremely relevant areas in the IT job market. 

So without any further comments, let me present to you this new Chat bot.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:

Ollama ðŸ¦„ - A very famous open source AI Model, created to make AI development more accessible and easier, allowing developers to create and contribute to the community with new projects and ideas

Python ðŸ’» - The best language for Machine Learning study and creation, with its clean syntax and readable code, ideal for robust projects and models.

I would love to hear your feedback and ideas!
How would you expand on this project?
